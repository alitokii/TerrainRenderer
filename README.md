# TerrainRenderer
A coding challenge to make a terrain renderer. I decided to use OpenGL.
This program offers two modes of terrain generation: Perlin noise and heightmap image. The rendered terrain is displayed with lighting and shading effects, and the user can interact with the scene using keyboard and mouse controls.

## Features Overview
* Generates 3D terrain using Perlin noise or heightmap images
* Renders the terrain with lighting and shading effects
* Supports toggling between wireframe rendering and surface normals rendering.
* Navigate through the terrain using keyboard controls
* Calculates and displays frame rate (FPS) in the console

## Dependencies
In order to build and run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

* OpenGL 3.3 or higher
* GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library)
* GLFW (OpenGL Framework)
* GLM (OpenGL Mathematics)
* stb_image.h (Single-file image loading library)

For compiling the program, you need to have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard. As well as cmake installed.
